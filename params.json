The name Digiband is the combination of Digimon and Smartband. Digimon is one of my favourite anime series, and I own some virtual pet device that can raise Digimons when I was little. It was really fun to play. And nowadays there're many smartband prodect that tracking your activity, helping you to lose weight. The idea is to use Virtual Pet as a stimuli to encourage people to get more exercise wearing smartbands.\r\n\r\nThe Digiband combines a Pedometer, a Virtual Pet and a Digital Watch all into a single wearable wristband. It can count how many steps you take everyday and during which your Digimon will advanture in its virtual world. It can fight enemy, find treasure, become stronger and evolve. There're over 70 different kinds fo Digimon and 8 adventure maps. The battle system is pretty fascinating for such a small device. It's a real-time rpg and you have to exercise to power your Digimon.\r\n\r\nThe core of this device is a Bluetooth4.0 chip, connected to a gyroscope and a LED screen. All powered by a rechargeable lithium battery. However due to manufacturing cost I couldn't turn it into a marketable product. But it's still very fun to play with the prototype.\r\n\r\n###To view the source code: \r\nDownload the .rar and unzip.\r\n\r\nOpen \\DigiCore\\Projects\\ble\\SimpleBLE\\CC2541DB\\SimpleBLETest.eww with IAR 8.1.0 or higher.\r\n\r\nBLE-STACK 1.4.1(Support for CC2540/CC2541) is required.\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nProgrammer, Engineer, Designer: Dun Mao\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease do not use this work for commercial purposes, thank you.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
